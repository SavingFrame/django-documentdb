## About This Fork

This project, **django-documentdb**, is a fork of the original **django-mongodb** repository, which was developed and maintained by the MongoDB Python Team. The primary purpose of this fork is to add compatibility with **AWS DocumentDB**, a MongoDB-compatible database service by Amazon Web Services. Due to differences between DocumentDB and MongoDBâ€™s API support, specific adjustments have been made to enable functionality within DocumentDB.

### Why Fork?
AWS DocumentDB currently supports a subset of MongoDB's API. Some features, such as `$expr` queries, are either partially supported or unsupported, leading to limitations when using libraries built for MongoDB directly. Given that the original `django-mongodb` repository was optimized for full MongoDB support, this fork introduces compatibility adjustments specifically for DocumentDB.
